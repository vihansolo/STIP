1. Introduction -

Statistical technique finds applications in businesses of all kind. Originally statistical techniques were developed for manual human applications found wanting for computer-aided procedures to expand the accuracy and speed. Computer-aided procedures ought to be based upon the strength of the machine and not translating human procedures into logic.

2. Objective -

Experiment with Python programming language to translate statistical techniques into logic. Developing proficiency in statistical techniques which can be applied to real time business processes and even research & analysis. To develop competency in GUI programming and GUI design. Documenting collaborative project work by a team consisting of two members and documenting their experiences in resolving deadlocks and complexities in carrying out the project at hand. Techniques to be addressed: -

    1) Technique for forecasting events based on the collection of previous experiences.
    2) Measures of central tendencies and measures of dispersions.
    3) Hypothesis analysis
    4) Regression analysis
    5) ANOVA

3. Methodology -

Developing source code to translate the process at hand using a Python IDE and Python graphics primitives. Learning statistical techniques on the same topic. Documentation of program code and project experience.
Expected outcome - A GUI embedded software for statistical techniques which can be useful in the realm of higher education and research.
